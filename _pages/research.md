My research focuses on understanding how the cryosphere and oceans interact in a variety of scales, using experimental and numerical methods. To see published work proceed to [publications](/publications). For short summaries of some of the work I am involved in read on. 

## Post Doc - Ice Shelf Ocean Interactions in the laboratory
Currently, I am working on developing laboratory experiments to understand the buoyant boundary currents produced by meltwater under ice shelves. The project involves numerical modelling of the problem using [SPINS](https://git.uwaterloo.ca/SPINS/SPINS_main), and identifying a laboratory setup. 

## PhD - Experimental and Numerical experiments on Internal Solitary Waves
With my PhD, I have turned to more of a process-based approach. In the first part I have investigated how the dynamics of shoaling internal solitary wave change in different stratification types. I hope to then apply this understanding of internal wave dynamics, instabilities and mixing, and experimental techniques to ice-ocean dynamics.

Three research questions are being addressed during this project so far:

-          How stratification affects the behaviour of shoaling Internal Solitary Waves?
-          How stratification impacts boluses produced by fissioning Internal Solitary Waves?
-          How do internal solitary waves interact with sea ice in the Arctic Ocean?

## BSc/MSc - Freshwater in the Arctic Ocean
My BSc, titled "What would be the global climatic implications of turning off Russian rivers flowing into the Arctic Ocean?" investigated the role of freshwater derived from 4 major siberian rivers in the Arctic Ocean stratifications, and the wider climate-scale implications of potential diversion of the freshwater source to provide water to the population centres of the USSR as part of the ["Sibaral" project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_river_reversal). This involved a simple 1-dimensional water column model, where the freshwater content at the surface was adjusted at a level equivalent to removing this freshwater source. 

This led on to my MSc research, titled "How does Siberian river outflow impact the onset and duration of sea ice formation and melt?". Focussing on the role that riverine freshwater plays in the formation and melt of sea ice in the Kara Sea, an important sea ice nursery, and receiver of large volumes of continental runoff, the research used EOF analysis on gridded satellite and reanalysis data to identify the spatio-temporal patterns in sea ice seasonality, and freshwater.
