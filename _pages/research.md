My research focuses on understanding how the cryosphere and oceans interact in a variety of scales. My BSc and MSc dissertations both investigated how large-scale freshwater patterns could influence the transfer of heat from warm Atlantic water to waters at the surface (and subsequently ice). To see published work proceed to [publications](/publications). For short summaries of some of the work I am involved in read on. 

With my PhD, I have turned to more of a process-based approach. In the first part I have investigated how the dynamics of shoaling internal solitary wave change in different stratification types. I hope to then apply this understanding of internal wave dynamics, instabilities and mixing, and experimental techniques to ice-ocean dynamics.

My PhD  Three research questions are being addressed during this project so far:

-          How stratification affects the behaviour of shoaling Internal Solitary Waves?
-          How stratification impacts boluses produced by fissioning Internal Solitary Waves?
-          How do internal solitary waves interact with sea ice in the Arctic Ocean?

## Overview of Internal Solitary Waves
Density interfaces between two fluids are able to support the propagation of waves. Just like the interface between air and water supports the waves we're used to seeing at the beach, internal waves can form on interfaces within the ocean, produced by vertical variations in temperature and salinity (and in turn, density). These waves are a crucial mechanism in the global cascade of energy from large scale inputs (tides and wind), to molecular scale output. 

Internal Solitary Waves are a particular kind of these waves, where a balance of nonlinear steepening and wave dispersion produce waves with large amplitude. Similar to the Surface Solitary Waves first discovered by John Scott Russell, these internal solitary waves are able to travel large distances without significant change of form or magnitude, and do not interact when they come together. 

### Laboratory Methods
As studying internal waves in situ, particularly in the Arctic Ocean, is practically challenging, I study internal waves in the laboratory using a purpose built 7m long, 30cm deep flume at Newcastle University. The tank is initially filled with dense, salty water, before a layer of fresher (lighter) water is slowly added to the surface using an array of sponges to prevent mixing with the lower layer. At one end of the tank is a removable gate, and behind this a further volume of the lighter fluid is added to the surface, to produce a step in the pycnocline. On removal of the gate, an internal wave forms, and propagates along the tank:

We visualise the flow using seeding particles illuminated by a vertical thin light sheet (e.g. https://youtu.be/2FGGAnJFoJo), and use Particle Image Velocimetry in [DigiFlow](http://www.dalzielresearch.com/digiflow/) to calculate synoptic velocity and vorticity fields. This method allows us to gain high spatial and temporal resolution to our observations, and really pick apart any dynamics we observe.

### Numerical Methods
In addition to the laboratory, we have recently been using the SPINS numerical model [(Subrich et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1002/fld.3788) to extend our experimental output further, and to gain a full suite of simultaneous measurements not available in the laboratory.

## Shoaling Internal Solitary Waves 


## Internal Waves in Ice Covered Waters
In the Arctic Ocean, these waves are much less energetic, but are particularly important in driving the circulation and distribution of water masses. With declines of sea ice, understanding how internal waves interact with sea ice, and how sea ice affects them is required to understand the Arcticâ€™s future. Observing waves in situ is particularly difficult so my project uses laboratory experiments to investigate the interactions between sea ice and internal waves. Using floats to model sea ice, we visualise the float motion from above, alongside visualising the wave:
