My research focuses on understanding how the cryosphere and oceans interact in a variety of scales. My BSc and MSc dissertations both investigated how large-scale freshwater patterns could influence the transfer of heat from warm Atlantic water to waters at the surface (and subsequently ice). To see published work proceed to [publications](/publications). For short summaries of some of the work I am involved in read on. 

With my PhD, I have turned to more of a process-based approach. In the first part I have investigated how the dynamics of shoaling internal solitary wave change in different stratification types. I hope to then apply this understanding of internal wave dynamics, instabilities and mixing, and experimental techniques to ice-ocean dynamics.

My PhD  Three research questions are being addressed during this project so far:

-          How stratification affects the behaviour of shoaling Internal Solitary Waves?
-          How stratification impacts boluses produced by fissioning Internal Solitary Waves?
-          How do internal solitary waves interact with sea ice in the Arctic Ocean?

## Overview of Internal Waves
Density stratification in the world’s oceans support the propagation of Internal Waves. These waves are a crucial mechanism in the global cascade of energy from large scale inputs (tides and wind), to molecular scale output. In the Arctic Ocean, these waves are much less energetic, but are particularly important in driving the circulation and distribution of water masses. With declines of sea ice, understanding how internal waves interact with sea ice, and how sea ice affects them is required to understand the Arctic’s future. Observing waves in situ is particularly difficult so my project uses laboratory experiments to investigate the interactions between sea ice and internal waves.

## Shoaling Internal Solitary Waves 
### Laboratory Methods
As studying internal waves in situ, particularly in the Arctic Ocean, is practically challenging, I study internal waves in the laboratory using a purpose built flume at Newcastle University, which we visualise using seeding particles illuminated by a vertical thin light sheet (e.g. https://youtu.be/2FGGAnJFoJo). This method allows us to gain high spatial and temporal resolution to our observations, and really pick apart any dynamics we observe.

### Numerical Methods
In addition to the laboratory, we have recently been using the SPINS numerical model [(Subrich et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1002/fld.3788) to extend our experimental output further, and to gain a full suite of simultaneous measurements not available in the laboratory.
