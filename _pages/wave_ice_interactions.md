The Arctic Ocean is a unique oceanographic environment for a few key reasons:

- Unlike most oceans around the world, the Arctic Ocean's heat is contained at intermediate depth, as warm but salty waters are overlaid by cold but fresh waters. The heat remaining at depth is crucial for the presence of sea ice.
- Internal Tides are unable to propagate freely at high latitudes, their nonlinear counterparts become particularly important
- The presence of sea ice changes the transfers of heat and momentum between the ocean and atmosphere, including the generation and propagation of internal waves. Yet, this sea ice is rapidly declining, and a key question for us is what those changes will do to the Arctic Ocean. 

For these reasons, understanding the processes around internal waves and ice are important. Observing this region directly is difficult and expensive, remote sensing provides us with some insight, but we use idealised experiments to understand the processes better. Carr et al. (2019) conducted experiments with real ice interacting with Internal Solitary Waves (published in [Geophysical Research Letters](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019GL084710)). These have been followed up by further experiments, currently under review.
