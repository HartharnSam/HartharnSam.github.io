### Outreach
Through my time at Bangor University, I became engaged in outreach events (both on the subject, and university level), mostly revolving around events targetted at Year 12 at the stage that students consider the next steps, at which point discussing the possibilities and opportunities of university study can be particularly valuable. I am also a [STEM Ambassador](https://www.stem.org.uk/).

I am now involved once again in outreach as part of the ONE Planet Outreach project's committee. The project focusses on providing off-curriculum and transdisciplinary environmental science education on topics related to climate change and ecological and environmental breakdown, and raising awareness for and promote science career paths. Events so far have included
- Discover COP School Visit : A day of workshops for Y10-12 students exploring extreme weather events, and later negotiating to prioritise COP 26 Goals as the countries effected by those events 
- Discover COP Science Fair : A day of interactive exhibitions and chance to interact with PGR scientists to explore the science behind COP 26 at the Great North Museum: Hancock
- Ask and Answer : Event with Great North Museum: Hancock, for primary school groups to ask questions to experts related to the Living Planet exhibition. 
- Great North Museum / Newcastle University STEM Outreach family fun day: An event aimed at younger families to explore a range of science stands, for which we used popular games (e.g. jenga, kerplunk) to demonstrate environmental change. 
- Great North Museum's Big Fun \| After Hours (in planning) : An event aimed at over-18s to give the freedom to explore exhibits, games and interactive demonstrations to understand the interactions between COP26 for climate change and COP15 for biodiversity. 


### Other Academic Service
I am involved in demonstrating within my academic school, demonstrating on the MAS-1803 first year Python module. 

As ONE Planet Cohort 1 Student Rep, I am engaged with many other aspects of the DTP, which has included organising the Our Planet: ONE Planet Research Expo (research conference 2020), and representing the ONE Planet researchers. 

I am currently Treasurer of the UK Polar Network (UKPN), where I aim to ensure that the network can help support other Polar Early Career Researchers.

I have been involved in paper reviews for Journal of Fluid Mechanics, Nature Communications Earth & Environment, Geophysical Research Letters, and Physical Review Fluids.
