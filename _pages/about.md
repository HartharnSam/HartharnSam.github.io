## About Me
I am an experimental oceanographer. I am interested in using laboratory experiments (and laboratory scale simulations) to better understand the ocean interacts with ice in some of the hardest to observe regions on earth. Overall, I aim to understand how oceanic heat reaches and melts ice by combining laboratory experiments and numerical simulations to understand fundamental physical processes from the polar oceans. Alongside my research, I am involved in scientific leadership, outreach, and fostering collaboration within the academic and polar communities. You can find my full cv at the bottom of this page. 

### Research 
During my PhD, I used a combination of a combination of laboratory experiments and numerical modelling to study interactions between sea ice and Internal Solitary Waves (ISWs) [(Hartharn-Evans et al., 2024b)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2023JC020175). I have also worked with collaborators at the University of Waterloo (where the numerical model SPINS was developed) to produce a new data-centric method for understanding mixing in stratified fluids [(Hartharn-Evans et al 2024b)](https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-31-61-2024). Throughout my PhD I worked on methods to combine and compare laboratory experiments, numerical models, and theory [(Hartharn-Evans et al., 2024a, 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2021.1049).

### Supporting the Research Community

As vice-president (formerly co-president) of the UK Polar Network, I am involved in leadership of the Polar Early Career Researcher (ECR) community, representing over 600 ECRs in discussions with stakeholders like the British Antarctic Territory. A key part of this position is advocating for inclusivity and diversity in polar science, ensuring that Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) issues are considered centrally to the conversation around polar science, as well as working generally to deliver training and collaboration opportunities for ECRs. During my PhD I also served as a student representative for the ONE Planet Doctoral Training Partnership (DTP), I worked to create an interdisciplinary community and helped organize a virtual conference during the pandemic, fostering collaboration and support during a challenging time. I have also co-supervised four final year undergraduate (BSc) and postgraduate (MMath) projects using the SPINS numerical model, allowing me to share my expertise, and foster collaborations within our research environment. 

### Supporting outreach and education 
![outreach](/assets/images/outreach.jpeg){: .align-right style="width: 30%;"}
I enjoy sharing science and the polar regions with the wider community. I’ve led and participated in outreach programs that make complex scientific concepts accessible to the public. As part of the ONE Planet Outreach program, I delivered climate change sessions at the Great North Museum: Hancock and co-designed a week-long climate curriculum for primary schools. I believe it’s vital to engage with young people and the general public to help them understand the importance of polar regions and climate science.
