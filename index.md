intro: 
  - excerpt: "I am a researcher at Northumbria University in the Department of Geography and Environmental Sciences. I have an interest in understanding the physical processes in the ocean, and how they interact with different elements of the earth system. In particular, I research the processes surrounding the ice in the polar oceans, investigating the interactions between ice shelves ice and buoyant meltwater plumes in the laboratory (and laboratory scale numerical modelling). Previously I studied for a BSc in Marine Biology and Oceanography, an MSc in Physical Oceanography at Bangor University, and PhD in Applied Mathematics at Newcastle University. I maintain an interest in multidisciplinary applications of physical oceanography, and how these interact with the fluid dynamics."

    title: "Research Interests"
    excerpt: 'My research focuses on understanding how the cryosphere and oceans interact in a variety of scales. My BSc and MSc dissertations both investigated how large-scale freshwater patterns could influence the transfer of heat from warm Atlantic water to waters at the surface (and subsequently ice). My PhD Project, titled “internal solitary waves in ice-covered waters”, turns to more of a process-based approach. This project investigates how oceanic internal solitary waves (which are waves travel along density interfaces within the water column, and act in a “solitary” manner) interacts with sea ice. This research is primarily laboratory based, using a 7m long flume tank in our laboratory, along with numerical simulations.'

    excerpt: 'I am currently the Antarctic President of the UK Polar Network ([UKPN](https://polarnetwork.org/)), organising workshops, education and outreach opportunities for early career polar researchers, and providing networking opportunities that supports the next generation of polar researchers. I have experience demonstrating, and have outreach experience both delivering sessions and organising larger projects as part of the ONE Planet Outreach project. In my spare time, I enjoy cycling, swimming, and am a keen trombone player, playing with a local 2nd section brass band, Felling Band, and acting as charity trustee of the [UniBrass Foundation](https://www.unibrass.co.uk) to support university level brass banding.'
