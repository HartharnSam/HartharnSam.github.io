  - title: "About Me"
    excerpt: "I am a researcher at Northumbria University's Department of Geography and Environmental Sciences. My work aims to understand the physical processes in the ocean, and how they interact with different elements of the earth system. My main focus is on the polar oceans, and I currently investigate the interactions between ice shelves ice and buoyant meltwater plumes using both laboratory experiments and numerical modelling to understand these complex processes."

    title: "Research Interests"
    excerpt: 'My research is centred on understanding interactions between the cryosphere and oceans at a variety of scales. Currently, I am exploring ice shelf-ocean interactions through laboratory experiments. My PhD Project, "Experimental and Numerical Simulations of Boundary Effects on Internal Solitary Waves” examines how oceanic internal solitary waves (which travel along density interfaces within the water column, and act in a “solitary” manner) interact with sea ice, and underwater slopes. This was primarily conducted in a 7m long flume tank, and was complemented by numerical simulations. Understanding diapycnal mixing of fluids is crucial in these studies, and I have developed tools to better analyse these processes. '

    excerpt: 'I am the Antarctic President of the UK Polar Network ([UKPN](https://polarnetwork.org/)), where I organise training, networking, education and outreach opportunities to support the next generation of early career polar researchers. I also have outreach experience in delivering outreach sessions and managing larger projects as part of the ONE Planet Outreach project. In my spare time, I enjoy playing trombone with the Felling Band, a local second section brass band, and serve as charity trustee of the [UniBrass Foundation](https://www.unibrass.co.uk), supporting university level brass banding.'
