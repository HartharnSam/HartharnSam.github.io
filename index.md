I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences][cims], [NYU][nyu], exploring the richness of oceanic turbulence and transport. Prior to moving to New York, I received a PhD at the [Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Institute, Florida State University][gfdi], and an undergraduate chemical engineering degree from the [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Goa][bits].


Here is my [CV](/assets/documents/balwada_CV_Feb_2019.pdf)
