intro: 
  - excerpt: "I am a researcher at Northumbria University in the Department of Geography and Environmental Sciences. I have an interest in understanding the physical processes in the ocean, and how they interact with different elements of the earth system. In particular, I research the processes surrounding the ice in the polar oceans, investigating the interactions between ice shelves ice and buoyant meltwater plumes in the laboratory (and laboratory scale numerical modelling)."

    title: "Research Interests"
    excerpt: 'My research focuses on understanding how the cryosphere and oceans interact in a variety of scales. Currently my focus is on understanding ice shelf ocean interactions by conducting experiments in a laboratory setting. My PhD Project, "Experimental and Numerical Simulations of Boundary Effects on Internal Solitary Waves” employed a process-based approach. This project investigates how oceanic internal solitary waves (which are waves travel along density interfaces within the water column, and act in a “solitary” manner) interacts with sea ice. This was primarily a laboratory based study, utilising a 7m long flume tank in our laboratory, complelemeted  with numerical simulations. Within all of these studies, diapycnal mixing of fluids is an important process to understand, and I have worked on tools to better understand this.'

    excerpt: 'I am currently the Antarctic President of the UK Polar Network ([UKPN](https://polarnetwork.org/)), organising training, networking, education and outreach opportunities to support the next generation of early career polar researchers. I have outreach experience delivering sessions and organising larger projects as part of the ONE Planet Outreach project. In my spare time, I am a keen trombone player, playing with a local 2nd section brass band, Felling Band, and acting as charity trustee of the [UniBrass Foundation](https://www.unibrass.co.uk) to support university level brass banding.'
