### Academic Roadmap
I am a PhD Researcher at Newcastle University's School of Mathematics, Statistics and Physics, funded as part of the [ONE Planet Doctoral Training Programme](https://research.ncl.ac.uk/one-planet/ourprogramme/). Initially studying a degree in Marine Biology and Oceanography at Bangor University, I have an interest in understanding physical processes in the ocean, and how they interact with different systems, in particular sea ice in the rapidly changing Arctic Ocean. Previously I investigated the role of freshwater in the Arctic Ocean, but now in my PhD focus on the specific processes around internal waves.

### Research Interests

My research focuses on understanding how the cryosphere and oceans interact in a variety of scales. My BSc and MSc dissertations both investigated how large-scale freshwater patterns could influence the transfer of heat from warm Atlantic water to waters at the surface (and subsequently ice). 

My PhD Project, titled “internal solitary waves in ice-covered waters”, turns to more of a process-based approach. This project investigates how oceanic internal solitary waves (which are waves travel along density interfaces within the water column, and act in a “solitary” manner) interacts with sea ice. This research is primarily laboratory based, using a 7m long flume tank in our laboratory, along with numerical simulations.
