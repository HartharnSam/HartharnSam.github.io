intro:
 - excerpt: "I am a PhD Researcher at Newcastle University's School of Mathematics, Statistics and Physics, funded as part of the [ONE Planet Doctoral Training Programme](https://research.ncl.ac.uk/one-planet/ourprogramme/). Studying my BSc in Marine Biology and Oceanography, and an MSc in Physical Oceanography at Bangor University, I have an interest in understanding physical processes in the ocean, and how they interact with different systems. In particular I research the processes surrounding sea ice in the rapidly changing Arctic Ocean, currently by investigating the interactions between sea ice and internal solitary waves in the laboratory."

    excerpt: "My research focuses on understanding how the cryosphere and oceans interact in a variety of scales. My BSc and MSc dissertations both investigated how large-scale freshwater patterns could influence the transfer of heat from warm Atlantic water to waters at the surface (and subsequently ice). My PhD Project, titled “internal solitary waves in ice-covered waters”, turns to more of a process-based approach. This project investigates how oceanic internal solitary waves (which are waves travel along density interfaces within the water column, and act in a “solitary” manner) interacts with sea ice. This research is primarily laboratory based, using a 7m long flume tank in our laboratory, along with numerical simulations."

    title: "Other Interests"
    excerpt: "I am involved in demonstrating within my academic school, and am also engaged in outreach as part of the ONE Planet Outreach project. As ONE Planet Cohort 1 Student Rep, I am engaged with many other aspects of the DTP. I am currently Treasurer of the UK Polar Network ([UKPN](https://polarnetwork.org/)), where I aim to ensure that the network can help support other Polar Early Career Researchers.

In my spare time, I enjoy cycling, swimming, and am a keen trombone player, playing with a local 2nd section brass band, Felling Band, and acting as charity trustee of the [UniBrass Foundation](https://www.unibrass.co.uk) to support university level brass banding."
